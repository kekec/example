#implementation
  The latch class consists of the motor and the sensor. Opon calling
  the constructor of latch both classes are initialized.
  The test file creates all objects and implements a FSM. It loops
  over the contents of the sensor array and sums up all values. The
  implementation assumes that summing up all values does cause any overflow (ST_SUM). 
  In ST_CAL the average value of the sensor array is calculated. ST_SEEK_POS 
  tries to find the calculates average value within the sensor array. 
  If it is not found we enter ST_SEEK_MIN_DIST which loops over all values 
  in the sensor array and tries to find the sensor value heaving the 
  smallest distance to the avg value. Finally ST_SET_MOTOR sets the motor 
  to the sensor value of the minimal distance and opens the door.

  latch.cpp:[23-24]
  In order to store the values of the sensor array I used a buffer that 
  is allocated as an auto variable. A pointer to this buffer is passed 
  to the latch class and to the sensor class. I am not sure why the assigment
  of the pointers did not work.  When debugging with gdb I was not able to see the assignment of the pointers.
  I used memcpy to copy the content of the pointers.
